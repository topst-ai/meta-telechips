Subject: [PATCH] sort.c: Reorder includes for glibc 2.34 portability

With glibc 2.34 config.h will include stdlib.h and that would disable
sys/wait.h to include needed definitions from bits/waitflags.h since
_STDLIB_H would have been defined already and sys/wait.h would think
these paths are included already, this is fixed with newer gnulib and
configure so this is to get this old version to compile with latest
glibc headers
